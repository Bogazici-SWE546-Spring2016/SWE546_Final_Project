# SWE546_Final_Project
Final Project for data mining

As the final project, you will develop a method for recommendation. 

Steps: 
- Form groups of two or three. If you prefer to do so, you can also work alone.
- Analyze the public data set given in http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html
The goal is to develop a recommendation system, by predicting the ratings for unobserved user-movie pairs. 

You need to submit a report, preferably as an jupyter notebook, that contains 
- the description of the dataset along with snapshots of visualizations
- a mathematical description of the models that you have developed and any features that you have developed. There must be at least two different methods.
- the code for your simulations, should be runnable 
- a description and discussion of the evaluation criteria,
- an valuation of your system along with a comparion of the results by the methods you have proposed
- Submit your report with all the material by 3rd June, 19:00 by a pull request

Optional but recommended:
- Present your results at our final meeting in 3rd June, Wednesday.

You can also choose another data set, such as data from a kaggle competition such as
